## Day 1

### Description

```
Every year, Santa maintains the legendary Naughty-or-Nice list, and despite the rumors, there’s no magic behind it at all—it’s pure, meticulous byte-level bookkeeping. Your job is to apply every tiny change exactly and confirm the final list matches perfectly—check it once, check it twice, because Santa does not tolerate even a single incorrect byte. At the North Pole, it’s all just static analysis anyway: even a simple objdump | grep naughty goes a long way.
```


### Provided

```
/challenge/check-list
```


### My Solve

First check what type of file it is, run the binary

```
$ file /challenge/check-list
/challenge/check-list: setuid ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, BuildID[sha1]=bec7b06ce41d2387ff43f204bc4e91193111b83a, stripped
```

Running the binary stops at stdin, providing any input returns 

```
🚫 Wrong: Santa told you to check that list twice!
```
Naturally , I started decompiling with IDA. but i think the file was too large or something


Decided to go with dynamic analysis with gdb

```
gef➤  x/30i $rip

   0x401003:    sub    rsp,0x500

   0x401063:    add    BYTE PTR [rbp-0x264],0xe6
```

Up to 0x400 bytes are read from stdin and stored at [rbp-0x400]. In the next few instructions after the read syscall, these input bytes are manipulated, with random values being added to and subtracted from each byte.

Since there are a lot of these operations, I decided to just check what each byte ends up being compared with after all the add and subtract steps.


```
$ objdump -d -M intel /challenge/check-list | grep cmp| grep -o ',0x[0-9a-fA-F]\+' |  tr '\n' ' ' > cmp.txt
```

Extracting these bytes via grep, we have in a python list :

```

I decided to send 0x400 bytes 0xff via stdin, so that after the addition and subtraction operation is done , i can have the resulting bytes before the compare instructions , this way, i can know how to adjust my input so it ends up as the bytes i wxtracted above

```py
from pwn import *


context.update(arch="amd64")

gdbscript = """

```

I can calculate the values needed to be send such that after the operations we end up with the values compared with

```
result = []
for i in range((0x400)):
    result.append(((values[i] + (0xff - ola_val[i])) & 0xff))
```

Finally

```

payload = bytes(result)

p = process(path)

p.send(payload)
```
